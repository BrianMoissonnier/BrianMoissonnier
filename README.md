My name is Brian Moissonnier (pronounced: Moss-in-yay)
Iâ€™m currently working on AERE 361 and becoming an aerospace engineer.
I'm still new when it comes to programming I much prefer to focus on structures when it comes to engineering but I know I can't avoid it.
I would appreciate any and all help when it comes to learning github.
I hope to have a complete understanding of github as well as all other tools that I will use in AERE 361 by the end of the Fall 22 semester.

### A Few Things About Me

My favorite hobby of mine is playing tabletop RPG's with my friends.

An interesting fact about myself is that I am a certified welder.

I was born and raised in Arizona.
